# BasesPlayer
A short and sweet audio player plugin for Obsidian Bases View

## Quickstart

This plugin enables a play/pause button for Obsidian Bases Cards view, where audio links stored in frontmatter from notes can be played. 

It searches for: 

- .mp3
- .wav
- .ogg
- .m4a

### Set-up

1. Add a **property** in your Note’s frontmatter named **Music**: (property type = text)
2. Set a audiolink from a track in your vault: [[Track Name.mp3]] 
3. Go to your base view and toggle this property **Music** to view it in your Cards overview. 
4. Not showing? Force Reload or Reopen Obsidian.
